    <p class="lead">
      Our model uses linear regression to predict the price of a home.
    </p>

    <p>
      The features chosen for training include the number of different kinds of
      rooms, the size of the home, the presence of amenities and how furnished
      it is at the time of sale. The prediction made is approximately
      <b>61%</b> accurate.
